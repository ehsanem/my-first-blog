To create a virtual env:
python -m venv XXX

where XXX is the name of virtual environment
---

to active vitual environment:
XXX\Scripts\activate

---
to start a project in django:
django-admin.exe startproject mysite .

---
to start an application in django:
python manage.py startapp blog

** here we've created an application with name blog

---
After creating an application, we have to add it to the setting file under INSTALLED_APPS list
---

after creating an application, we must create a model which is in the folder of application (here it is blog)

---
in the models we write a code which is based on application content. Here, we have a blog and want to create a model which takes properties like:
author, title, text, created_date and publish_date. In a model we have to specify the type of each properties. All types inside the django
model end with Field. For example: CharField or TextField. after defining properties types, we have to define methods. Methods often return something.
So, in order to define a method we use function. Here is an example of a model:

from django.db import models
from django.utils import timezone


class Post(models.Model):
    author = models.ForeignKey('auth.User', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    text = models.TextField()
    created_date = models.DateTimeField(
            default=timezone.now)
    published_date = models.DateTimeField(
            blank=True, null=True)

    def publish(self):
        self.published_date = timezone.now()
        self.save()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
---
***everything that ends with Field is fieldtype
---

After creating model, we have to prepare it for transfer to the database:
python manage.py makemigrations blog

---
After preparing, we can move it to the database:
python manage.py migrate blog

---
after creating the model, we need to register it to make it visible for user. We can register it from the admin file which is in the the application folder.
here is an example:

from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Post

admin.site.register(Post)

here we've created Post (as a model) and inport it here then register it by above code.
---

if we want to see the result the we have to run server by:
python manage.py runserver
---
